# humhub-feedrss
This script is a workaround that allows HumHub to have RSS feeds of a profile's public posts.

This script depends on Parsedown - https://github.com/erusev/parsedown
# How to install
- Download rss.php
- Download Parsedown.php from https://github.com/erusev/parsedown
- Edit rss.php and insert your HumHub Name, Root link, Database host, name, user and password
- Upload into your HumHub root rss.php and Parsedown.php

# How to use
- Open a user's profile on your humhub
- My profile url is (example: https://www.selectallfromdual.com/chub/index.php?r=user%2Fprofile&cguid=5fe073b2-7795-4f08-b492-ed7559957d41)
- Change index.php with rss.php (example: https://www.selectallfromdual.com/chub/rss.php?r=user%2Fprofile&cguid=5fe073b2-7795-4f08-b492-ed7559957d41)
- The rss feed displays all public messages left by the account on its profile and in all public spaces
- Let's go and love HumHub and opensource

If you can and would like you can buy me a coffee. If you can't it's not a problem. Thank you.
